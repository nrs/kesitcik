This program aims to provide a framework for civil engineers to create and numerically 
analyze arbitrary composite beam cross sections according to Euler-Bernoulli beam 
theory. The mesh of the cross section is obtained by 2D triangulation (using the award 
winning program Triangle (c) by Shewchuk) and then analyzed according to linear 
flexural strain relations. The main purpose of this project is to provide better 
estimations for the strength of composite cross sections, such as reinforced concrete 
cross sections.

Triangle (c) by Jonathan Shewchuk is used  for 2D triangulation.
Some classes are from the open source finite element library libmesh.
